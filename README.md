# HubMap
This is code written for the Kaggle Competition: HuBMAP - Hacking the Human Vasculature. 
The competition deals with an Instance Segmentation problem to be scored using IoU and mAP. 

My code is a semantic segmentation model used to detect Vasculature in the human Kidney. 

The augmentations on the dataset for this code came from:https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03593.pdf

The project performs at a 57% validation accuracy on IoU
